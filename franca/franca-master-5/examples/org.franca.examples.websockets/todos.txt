********** TODOs for the Franca/JS example **********

Remarks:
- This file will be removed after the exploration mode is over,
  we will use Google's issue tracker again. This is just to be agile :-)
- Simply copy resolved issues to the DONE section.

NOW:

* Test usage of more complex data structures in example [Klaus]
  - prio 1: struct, array
  - prio 2: map, union

* Bug: Codegen for fireAndForget methods [Tamas]
  - if a method is flagged "fireAndForget", there is no response needed
  - see example SimpleUI.setOperation()
  - the generation of "replySetOperation" in the proxy should be removed

* Bug: Codegen for arguments [Tamas]
  - there is no call on server side to change the attribute's value
    (simply changing it with an assignment will not send updates to clients)
  - no onSet... callback should be generated on client side for readonly attributes

* Generate initial/example client/server interface
  - this serves as a quick starting point for developers

LATER:



DONE:
* Bug: More than one methods should work [Tamas]
  - currently only one of the method calls will work correctly
  - analysis: SimpleUIStub.js, it seems that only the last of the 
    register calls to "_this.server.rpc('invoke', ..." is registered, previous
    ones are neutralized by later ones.
* Support more than one out-argument for methods [Tamas]
  - startNavigation method in example could be used for this
* Bug:
  - (see attribute "clock" in the example)
  - the getClock() call during initialization fails (see TODO in example-application.js)
